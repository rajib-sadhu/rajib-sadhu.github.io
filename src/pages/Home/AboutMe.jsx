                    Iâ€™m a MERN developer. I have completed my B.Tech in Electronics and Communications from Adamas University.
                    But during my college we had some other computer related subjects like C and Java and I discovered that I was more interested towards Programming.
                    Then I started to learn Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and did some personal projects with that.
                    Then I explored the most popular library ReactJS and for the backend I explored node.js, express.js and MongoDB as a database. And I am too much passionate about video games like - FIFA, COD, Efootball etc, and have some experience on Graphics Design, Video Editing, And Basic Microsoft Office skills.
